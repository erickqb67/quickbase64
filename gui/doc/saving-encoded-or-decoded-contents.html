    <h1>Saving Encoded Or Decoded Contents</h1>
    <hr>
    <div class="body">
        <p>
            After encoding or decoding your file, you might want to save it.<br>
            The application provides you with a method for saving your files.<br>
            Saving an <a href="#saving-encoded-content">encoded content</a> is different from also saving <a href="#saving-decoded-content">decoded contents</a>.<br> 
            Let's take a look at both scenarios.
        </p>
        <div>
            <h2 id="saving-encoded-content">Saving Encoded Contents</h2>
            <p>After encoding your file, the application will allow you to save the contents.<br>
            There are three ways in which you can save encoded contents.<br>
            <ol>
                <li>Let Quick Base64 save it with a .txt extension</li>
                <li>Provide your own extension and save the file</li>
                <li>Copy the file to clipboard</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <img src="saving-file.png" alt="Saving a file">
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Allowing Quick Base64 to save the file</h3>
            <p>When you select this option after encoding a file to base64, the application will save your encoded contents in a file with .txt extension.<br>
            Also note that, the save file will take the name of the original file just that it will end in a .txt extension
        </p>
        <h3>Providing your own extension</h3>
        <p>
            When saving your encoded contents, you are allowed to provide your own extension.<br>
            To do that, select Save (Give ext.) option and this will allow you to save your file under your preferred extension.<br>
            Do note that when you select this option, your file will be saved under a new name not the name of the original file.<br>
            The name of the file will be provided by you.
            </p>
        <h3>Copying the results to clipboard</h3>
        <p>
            Also, you can copy the results into your system's clipboard.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2 id="saving-decoded-content">Saving decoded contents</h2>
            <p>
                After you are done decoding your file from base64 format, the application provides you with methods to save your file.<br>
                Also, there are three ways in which you can save your file.
                <ul>
                    <li>Let Quick Base64 save it by providing an extension.</li>
                    <li>Provide your own extension and save the file</li>
                    <li>Copy the file to clipboard</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Allowing the application to generate an extension</h3>
            <p>
                When you decode base64 contents, Quick Base64 can generate an extension for you file based on the mime-type of the decoded contents.<br>
                That is, Quick Base64 can decode base64 contents to it's original format without knowing the extension of the original file.<br>
                This is achieved using the file command.
                The file command can generate a mime type out of the decoded
                contents, then Quick Base64 will generate an extension based on the mime type.<br>
                This is really usefull if you have no idea about the contents you are decoding.
            </p>
            <h3>Providing your own extension</h3>
            <p>
                Also, you can also provide the extension for which the decoded file will be saved in.<br>
                This method comes in handy when you want to save the decoded contents in a specific file format.
            </p>
            <h3>Copying contents to clipboard</h3>
            <p>
            After decoding a file, you can just copy all of the contents to your system clipbord.
