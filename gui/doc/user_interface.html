            The image above is a screenshot of Quick Base64's user interface.

        <ol>
            <li>The <code>More...</code> button leads to a menu which provides you with more options.</li>
            <li><p>This is the drop area. You drag your file or text here to be encoded or decoded.<br>
            Right-clicking on the drop area also pop-up a context menu which provides you with alternative options to load a file into the application.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                After decoding or encoding your file, the encoded or decoded contents are displayed in this panel. When encoded or decoded objects have a size greater than 20000 bytes, only the first 20000
                bytes are displayed.<br>
                The reason is that, displaying more than that can cause the application to hang and not respond. Right-clicking on this area pops up a context menu which provides you with many options to save the file.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>The controls panel. This panel contains the controls for the application.<br>
            The encode radiobutton is set to on if you want to encode an object.<br>
            The decode radiobutton is set to on if you want to decode an object.<br>
            Also, you can check the auto-detect to on if you want the application to automatically detect the mode for you file.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>The status panel. This panel displays useful information to you.
                For example, if a file is not decoded or an error pops up, it is displayed on this panel.
            </p></li>
