                The auto-detect mode is nothing unique, it's just a bit of common sense. When you check the auto-detect to on, it over-rides the radiobuttons value.
                That is, even if the radio button is set to encode, and your file needs to be decoded, it will over-ride the encode and decode your file.<br>
                The auto-detect mode uses a simple conditional statement.<br>
                <span style="color: violet">if</span> your object contains base64 contents, it will decode.<br>
                <span style="color: violet">else</span> it will encode it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This mode is very useful as there are times when you don't know whether your file contains base64 contents or not.<br>
                Also, it speeds up the encoding and decoding because you don't need to set the mode yourself.
