        <p>
            Decoding a file from base64 format is almost the same as encoding.<br>
            The only difference between both methods is that, in decoding, the radiobutton must be turned to decode.<br>
            I am not going to explain much on this much because it is similar to the encoding method.

        <p>
            From the gif above, you can see various methods on how to decode a file from base64 format.<br>
            Do note that, when decoding, Quick Base64 validates the contents before decoding.<br>
            If an object being decoded is not of type base64, it will be rejected.
