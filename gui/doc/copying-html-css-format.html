    <hr>
    <p>
        This option is mainly for web developers, it allows you to copy the results in a way which you can insert in your html or css file.<br>
        Please note that this option is only available for base64 contents.

        <h2>Copying contents in HTML format</h2>
        <p> 
            Also note that, this option only works for images, audios and videos.<br>
            When ever you encode a file which belongs to any of these three groups, Quick Base64 will allow you to copy it in HTML format.<br>
            This might sound confusing so let me give an example,<br>
            If you encode an image of type JPG and you copy it in HTML format, you will get <code>&lt;image src='data:image/jpg;base64,base64contents'&gt;</code>.<br>
            Meaning Quick Base64 will generate the coresponding html tag with it's attributes.<br>
            Let's try another example and encode a video of type avi.<br>
            We will get <code>&lt;video controls src="data:video/avi;base64,base64contents"&gt;</code>.<br>
            So this way, the application takes care of everything, you just have to paste it into your text editor.
        </p>
        <h2>Copying contents in CSS format</h2>
        <p>
            Please note, this works for only images.<br>
            In CSS, when specifying the background image of an element, you can use base64.<br>This application makes it easy to get your image into your css file.<br>
            For example, if you copying an image in CSS format, you will get a results similar to this.<br>
            <code>url(data:image/jpg;base64, base64contents)</code>. This enables you to simply copy it inside your CSS file.
